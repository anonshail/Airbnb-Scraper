# Airbnb-Scraper
A PoC script that lets you scrape Airbnb listings data in a certain time frame in a certain coordinate box. For this PoC, I have assumed the edges of Boston and found out all the Airbnb listings in that time in Boston. However, by simple changing the coordinates, this script could be used to scrape any and all Airbnb listings based on your requirements.
